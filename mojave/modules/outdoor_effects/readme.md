## Title: <!--Title of your addition-->

<!-- uppercase, underscore_connected name of your module, that you use to mark files-->
MODULE ID: OUTDOOR_EFFECTS 

### Description:

This PR adds outdoor effects to MS in the form of Weather, using particle effects, and sunlight, which adds to the lighting system.

Each turf is given an Outdoor_effects object, that holds up to two overlays - one for weather and one for sunlight.

Sunlight is governed by three "states" on a turf, based on a roof_type 
SKY_BLOCKED
SKY_VISIBLE
SKY_VISIBLE_BORDER


Weather is affected by whether or not the roof above is weatherproof - for now this is limited to space/open_space
