  - qol: "Pushing off something in space will no longer cause it to be delayed for half a second before drifting properly. Should look nicer now"
  - bugfix: "Fixed being able to push \"off\" something you're moving towards, allowing for infinite movement in one direction in space, at your walk speed"
